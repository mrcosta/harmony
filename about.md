Hi, my name is Mateus and I like to code =)<br/>
I have passion for building software with quality and creative solutions for who will use and maintain.

TDD and Clean Code as essential skills in my day to day. Iâ€™m also playing a little with blockchains and advocating for privacy on the internet.
