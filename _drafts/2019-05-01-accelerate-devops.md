## 1. Some thoughts

It's good to work in projects that use latest practices applied by the industry, but sometimes that is not the case
and you have to sell this fish to your boss in order to change organization. Sometimes just changing processes for the
sake of trying to make the company is not enough, so have numbers and a whole book to prove their point with numbers
is something that makes you even more confident to purpose something at your workspace.  

## 2. What they found

* velocity is designed to be used as a capacity planning tool (how long it will take to finish the tasks);
* the measure should focus on outcomes not output
* we should measure: delivery lead time, deployment frequency, time to restore service and change fail rate.
    * delivery part of the lead time: the time it takes for work to be implemented, tested, and delivered.
    * product delivery lead time: the time it takes to go from code committed to code successfully running in production.
    * deployment frequency: a software deployment to production or to an app store.
    * how quickly can a service be restored?
    * what percentage of changes to production fail
    
* software delivery performance impacts organizational performance and noncommercial performance.
* the fact that software delivery performance matters provides a strong argument against outsourcing the development of software
that is strategic to your business.
